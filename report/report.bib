@article{aust:alle:mcco:dar:wilg:sayl:sama:cox:simp:gene:2006,
	Abstract = {Recent work demonstrates that stochastic fluctuations in
		  molecular populations have consequences for gene
		  regulation. Previous experiments focused on noise sources
		  or noise propagation through gene networks by measuring
		  noise magnitudes. However, in theoretical analysis, we
		  showed that noise frequency content is determined by the
		  underlying gene circuits, leading to a mapping between gene
		  circuit structure and the noise frequency range. An
		  intriguing prediction from our previous studies was that
		  negative autoregulation shifts noise to higher frequencies
		  where it is more easily filtered out by gene networks--a
		  property that may contribute to the prevalence of
		  autoregulation motifs (for example, found in the regulation
		  of approximately 40% of Escherichia coli genes). Here we
		  measure noise frequency content in growing cultures of E.
		  coli, and verify the link between gene circuit structure
		  and noise spectra by demonstrating the negative

	Abstract = {The invariant cell lineage and cell fate of provide a
		  unique opportunity to decode the molecular mechanisms of
		  animal development. To exploit this opportunity, we have
		  developed a system for automated cell lineage tracing
		  during embryogenesis, based on 3D, time-lapse imaging and
		  automated image analysis. Using ubiquitously expressed
		  histone--GFP fusion protein to label cells/nuclei and a
		  confocal microscope, the imaging protocol captures
		  embryogenesis at high spatial (31 planes at 1 $\mu$m apart)
		  and temporal (every minute) resolution without apparent
		  effects on development. A set of image analysis algorithms
		  then automatically recognizes cells at each time point,
		  tracks cell movements, divisions and deaths over time and
		  assigns cell identities based on the canonical naming
		  scheme. Starting from the four-cell stage (or earlier), our
		  software, named , can trace the lineage up to the 350-cell
		  stage in 25 min on a desktop computer. The few errors of
		  automated lineaging can then be corrected in a few hours
		  with a graphic interface that allows easy navigation of the
		  images and the reported lineage tree. The system can be
		  used to characterize lineage phenotypes of genes and/or
		  extended to determine gene expression patterns in a living
		  embryo at the single-cell level. We envision that this
		  automation will make it practical to systematically
		  decipher the developmental genes and pathways encoded in
		  the genome of .},

	Abstract = { In the past 10years a statistical technique, approximate
		  Bayesian computation (ABC), has been developed that can be
		  used to infer parameters and choose between models in the
		  complicated scenarios that are often considered in the
		  environmental sciences. For example, based on gene sequence
		  and microsatellite data, the method has been used to choose
		  between competing models of human demographic history as
		  well as to infer growth rates, times of divergence, and
		  other parameters. The method fits naturally in the Bayesian
		  inferential framework, and a brief overview is given of the
		  key concepts. Three main approaches to ABC have been
		  developed, and these are described and compared. Although
		  the method arose in population genetics, ABC is
		  increasingly used in other fields, including epidemiology,
		  systems biology, ecology, and agent-based modeling, and
		  many of these applications are briefly described. },

	Abstract = {Much of the information available about factors that
		  affect mRNA decay in Escherichia coli, and by inference in
		  other bacteria, has been gleaned from study of less than 25
		  of the [approx]4,300 predicted E. coli messages. To
		  investigate these factors more broadly, we examined the
		  half-lives and steady-state abundance of known and
		  predicted E. coli mRNAs at single-gene resolution by using
		  two-color fluorescent DNA microarrays. An rRNA-based
		  strategy for normalization of microarray data was developed
		  to permit quantitation of mRNA decay after transcriptional
		  arrest by rifampicin. We found that globally, mRNA
		  half-lives were similar in nutrient-rich media and defined
		  media in which the generation time was approximately
		  tripled. A wide range of stabilities was observed for
		  individual mRNAs of E. coli, although [approx]80% of all
		  mRNAs had half-lives between 3 and 8 min. Genes having
		  biologically related metabolic functions were commonly
		  observed to have similar stabilities. Whereas the
		  half-lives of a limited number of mRNAs correlated
		  positively with their abundance, we found that overall,
		  increased mRNA stability is not predictive of increased
		  abundance. Neither the density of putative sites of
		  cleavage by RNase E, which is believed to initiate mRNA
		  decay in E. coli, nor the free energy of folding of 5' or
		  3' untranslated region sequences was predictive of mRNA
		  half-life. Our results identify previously unsuspected
		  features of mRNA decay at a global level and also indicate
		  that generalizations about decay derived from the study of
		  individual gene transcripts may have limited
		  applicability.},

	Abstract = {Recent advances in measuring gene expression at the
		  single-cell level have highlighted the stochastic nature of
		  messenger RNA and protein synthesis. Stochastic gene
		  expression creates a source of variability in the abundance
		  of cellular components, even among isogenic cells exposed
		  to an identical environment. Recent integrated experimental
		  and modelling studies have shed light on the molecular
		  sources of this variability. However, many of these studies
		  focus on systems that have reached a steady state and
		  therefore do not address a large class of dynamic phenomena
		  including oscillatory gene expression. Here we develop a
		  general protocol for analysing and predicting stochastic
		  gene expression in systems that never reach steady states.
		  We use this framework to analyse experimentally stochastic
		  expression of genes driven by the Synechococcus elongatus
		  circadian clock. We find that, although the average
		  expression at two points in the circadian cycle separated
		  by 12 hours is identical, the variability at these two time
		  points can be different. We show that this is a general
		  feature of out-of-steady-state systems. We demonstrate how
		  intrinsic noise sources, owing to random births and deaths
		  of mRNAs and proteins, or extrinsic noise sources, which
		  introduce fluctuations in rate constants, affect the
		  cell-to-cell variability. To distinguish experimentally
		  between these sources, we measured how the correlation
		  between expression fluctuations of two identical genes is
		  modulated during the circadian cycle. This quantitative
		  framework is generally applicable to any
		  out-of-steady-state system and will be necessary for
		  understanding the fidelity of dynamic cellular systems.},

	Abstract = {Here we studied the quantitative behaviour and
		  cell-to-cell variability of a prototypical eukaryotic
		  cell-fate decision system, the mating pheromone response
		  pathway in yeast. We dissected and measured sources of
		  variation in system output, analysing thousands of
		  individual, genetically identical cells. Only a small
		  proportion of total cell-to-cell variation is caused by
		  random fluctuations in gene transcription and translation
		  during the response ('expression noise'). Instead,
		  variation is dominated by differences in the capacity of
		  individual cells to transmit signals through the pathway
		  ('pathway capacity') and to express proteins from genes
		  ('expression capacity'). Cells with high expression
		  capacity express proteins at a higher rate and increase in
		  volume more rapidly. Our results identify two mechanisms
		  that regulate cell-to-cell variation in pathway capacity.
		  First, the MAP kinase Fus3 suppresses variation at high
		  pheromone levels, while the MAP kinase Kss1 enhances
		  variation at low pheromone levels. Second, pathway capacity
		  and expression capacity are negatively correlated,
		  suggesting a compensatory mechanism that allows cells to
		  respond more precisely to pheromone in the presence of a
		  large variation in expression capacity.},

	Abstract = {Molecular noise in gene expression can generate
		  substantial variability in protein concentration. However,
		  its effect on the precision of a natural eukaryotic circuit
		  such as the control of cell cycle remains unclear. We use
		  single-cell imaging of fluorescently labelled budding yeast
		  to measure times from division to budding (G1) and from
		  budding to the next division. The variability in G1
		  decreases with the square root of the ploidy through a
		  1N/2N/4N ploidy series, consistent with simple stochastic
		  models for molecular noise. Also, increasing the gene
		  dosage of G1 cyclins decreases the variability in G1. A new
		  single-cell reporter for cell protein content allows us to
		  determine the contribution to temporal G1 variability of
		  deterministic size control (that is, smaller cells
		  extending G1). Cell size control contributes significantly
		  to G1 variability in daughter cells but not in mother
		  cells. However, even in daughters, size-independent noise
		  is the largest quantitative contributor to G1 variability.
		  Exit of the transcriptional repressor Whi5 from the nucleus
		  partitions G1 into two temporally uncorrelated and
		  functionally distinct steps. The first step, which depends
		  on the G1 cyclin gene CLN3, corresponds to noisy size
		  control that extends G1 in small daughters, but is of
		  negligible duration in mothers. The second step, whose
		  variability decreases with increasing CLN2 gene dosage, is
		  similar in mothers and daughters. This analysis decomposes
		  the regulatory dynamics of the Start transition into two
		  independent modules, a size sensing module and a timing
		  module, each of which is predominantly controlled by a
		  different G1 cyclin.},

		  essential functions in living cells, but the 'design
		  principles' underlying the functioning of such
		  intracellular networks remain poorly understood, despite
		  intensive efforts including quantitative analysis of
		  relatively simple systems. Here we present a complementary
		  approach to this problem: the design and construction of a
		  synthetic network to implement a particular function. We
		  used three transcriptional repressor systems that are not
		  part of any natural biological clock to build an
		  oscillating network, termed the repressilator, in
		  Escherichia coli. The network periodically induces the
		  synthesis of green fluorescent protein as a readout of its
		  state in individual cells. The resulting oscillations, with
		  typical periods of hours, are slower than the cell-division
		  cycle, so the state of the oscillator has to be transmitted
		  from generation to generation. This artificial clock
		  displays noisy behaviour, possibly because of stochastic
		  fluctuations of its components. Such 'rational network
		  design may lead both to the engineering of new cellular
		  behaviours and to an improved understanding of naturally

		  review a number of recent modeling studies that focus on
		  systems specifically involving gene expression and
		  regulation. These systems include bacterial metabolic
		  operons and phase-variable piliation, bacteriophages T7 and
		  lambda, and interacting networks of eukaryotic
		  developmental genes. A wide range of conceptual and
		  mathematical representations of genetic components and
		  phenomena appears in these works. We discuss these
		  representations in depth and give an overview of the tools
		  currently available for creating and exploring dynamical
		  models. We argue that for modeling to realize its full
		  potential as a mainstream biological research technique the
		  tools must become more general and flexible, and formal,
		  standardized representations of biological knowledge and
		  data must be developed. },

		  estimation of stochastic rate constants in the context of
		  dynamic models of intracellular processes. The underlying
		  discrete stochastic kinetic model is replaced by a
		  diffusion approximation (or stochastic differential
		  equation approach) where a white noise term models
		  stochastic behavior and the model is identified using
		  equispaced time course data. The estimation framework
		  involves the introduction of m- 1 latent data points
		  between every pair of observations. MCMC methods are then
		  used to sample the posterior distribution of the latent
		  process and the model parameters. The methodology is
		  applied to the estimation of parameters in a prokaryotic
		  autoregulatory gene network. },

	Abstract = {Microscope-based cytometry provides a powerful means to
		  study cells in high throughput. Here we present a set of
		  refined methods for making sensitive measurements of large
		  numbers of individual Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells over
		  time. The set consists of relatively simple 'wet' methods,
		  microscope procedures, open-source software tools and
		  statistical routines. This combination is very sensitive,
		  allowing detection and measurement of fewer than 350
		  fluorescent protein molecules per living yeast cell. These
		  methods enabled new protocols, including 'snapshot'
		  protocols to calculate rates of maturation and degradation
		  of molecular species, including a GFP derivative and a
		  native mRNA, in unperturbed, exponentially growing yeast
		  cells. Owing to their sensitivity, accuracy and ability to
		  track changes in individual cells over time, these
		  microscope methods may complement flow-cytometric
		  measurements for studies of the quantitative physiology of
		  cellular systems.},

	Abstract = {The ability to construct synthetic gene networks enables
		  experimental investigations of deliberately simplified
		  systems that can be compared to qualitative and
		  quantitative models. If simple, well-characterized modules
		  can be coupled together into more complex networks with
		  behaviour that can be predicted from that of the individual
		  components, we may begin to build an understanding of
		  cellular regulatory processes from the 'bottom up'. Here we
		  have engineered a promoter to allow simultaneous repression
		  and activation of gene expression in Escherichia coli. We
		  studied its behaviour in synthetic gene networks under
		  increasingly complex conditions: unregulated, repressed,
		  activated, and simultaneously repressed and activated. We
		  develop a stochastic model that quantitatively captures the
		  means and distributions of the expression from the
		  engineered promoter of this modular system, and show that
		  the model can be extended and used to accurately predict
		  the in vivo behaviour of the network when it is expanded to
		  include positive feedback. The model also reveals the
		  counterintuitive prediction that noise in protein
		  expression levels can increase upon arrest of cell growth
		  and division, which we confirm experimentally. This work
		  shows that the properties of regulatory subsystems can be
		  used to predict the behaviour of larger, more complex
		  regulatory networks, and that this bottom-up approach can
		  provide insights into gene regulation.},

		  autocovariances among dependent samples obtained from data
		  augmentation, and consequently, the mixture approximation
		  produces estimates with smaller variances than the
		  empirical approximation. The covariance structure results
		  are used to compare different augmentation schemes. It is

	Abstract = {Cellular behavior has traditionally been investigated by
		  utilizing bulk-scale methods that measure average values
		  for a population of cells. Such population-wide studies
		  mask the behavior of individual cells and are often
		  insufficient for characterizing biological processes in
		  which cellular heterogeneity plays a key role. A unifying
		  theme of many recent studies has been a focus on the
		  development and utilization of single-cell experimental
		  techniques that are capable of probing key biological
		  phenomena in individual living cells. Recently, novel
		  information about gene expression dynamics has been
		  obtained from single-cell experiments that draw upon the
		  unique capabilities of fluorescent reporter proteins.},

	Abstract = {Circadian oscillators, which provide internal daily
		  periodicity, are found in a variety of living organisms,
		  including mammals, insects, plants, fungi and
		  cyanobacteria. Remarkably, these biochemical oscillators
		  are resilient to external and internal modifications, such
		  as temperature and cell division cycles. They have to be
		  'fluctuation (noise) resistant' because relative
		  fluctuations in the number of messenger RNA and protein
		  molecules forming the intracellular oscillators are likely
		  to be large. In multicellular organisms, the strong
		  temporal stability of circadian clocks, despite molecular
		  fluctuations, can easily be explained by intercellular
		  interactions. Here we study circadian rhythms and their
		  stability in unicellular cyanobacteria Synechoccocus
		  elongatus. Low-light-level microscopy has allowed us to
		  measure gene expression under circadian control in single
		  bacteria, showing that the circadian clock is indeed a
		  property of individual cells. Our measurements show that
		  the oscillators have a strong temporal stability with a
		  correlation time of several months. In contrast to many
		  circadian clocks in multicellular organisms, this stability
		  seems to be ensured by the intracellular biochemical
		  network, because the interactions between oscillators seem
		  to be negligible.},

	Abstract = {Here we address the problem of parameter estimation
		  (inverse problem)of nonlinear dynamic biochemical pathways.
		  This problem is stated as a nonlinear programming
		  (NLP)problem subject to nonlinear differential-algebraic
		  constraints. These problems are known to be frequently
		  ill-conditioned and multimodal. Thus, traditional
		  (gradient-based)local optimization methods fail to arrive
		  at satisfactory solutions. To surmount this limitation, the
		  use of several state-of-the-art deterministic and
		  stochastic global optimization methods is explored. A case
		  study considering the estimation of 36 parameters of a
		  nonlinear biochemical dynamic model is taken as a
		  benchmark. Only a certain type of stochastic algorithm,
		  evolution strategies (ES), is able to solve this problem
		  successfully. Although these stochastic methods cannot
		  guarantee global optimality with certainty, their
		  robustness, plus the fact that in inverse problems they
		  have a known lower bound for the cost function, make them
		  the best available candidates.},

	Abstract = {Increasingly, successful research on metabolic systems
		  relies on teams of specialists. Because of the enormous
		  complexity of these systems, many experimental groups have
		  sought collaborations with theoreticians for data analysis
		  and modeling. Predictably, cultural differences in
		  scientific approach, methodology, assumptions, and language
		  have led to some persistent difficulties in communication
		  across the experiment-theory frontier. This report attempts
		  to diagnose some of these difficulties from the perspective
		  of 30 years' experience in both experimental and
		  theoretical biology, and to suggest guidelines for
		  effective collaboration between experimentalists and
		  theorists. As these collaborations move to the level of
		  cellular and molecular biology, effective communication
		  will become all the more important because the simple
		  linear rate laws of radiotracer and stable-isotope kinetics
		  will no longer suffice. This is because every form of
		  regulation and control, hallmarks of metabolic systems,
		  results in nonlinear kinetics. To advance this transition
		  to nonlinear cellular and molecular metabolic models and to
		  facilitate communication between experimental and
		  theoretical collaborators, a general procedure for
		  incorporating control mechanisms in metabolic rate laws is
		  developed based on the familiar rapid-equilibrium
		  assumption of classical enzyme kinetics.},

@article{reis:mand:time:2003,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:Emergency department (ED) based syndromic
		  surveillance systems identify abnormally high visit rates
		  that may be an early signal of a bioterrorist attack. For
		  example, an anthrax outbreak might first be detectable as
		  an unusual increase in the number of patients reporting to
		  the ED with respiratory symptoms. Reliably identifying
		  these abnormal visit patterns requires a good understanding
		  of the normal patterns of healthcare usage. Unfortunately,
		  systematic methods for determining the expected number of
		  (ED) visits on a particular day have not yet been well
		  established. We present here a generalized methodology for
		  developing models of expected ED visit rates.METHODS:Using
		  time-series methods, we developed robust models of ED
		  utilization for the purpose of defining expected visit
		  rates. The models were based on nearly a decade of
		  historical data at a major metropolitan academic, tertiary
		  care pediatric emergency department. The historical data
		  were fit using trimmed-mean seasonal models, and additional
		  models were fit with autoregressive integrated moving
		  average (ARIMA) residuals to account for recent trends in
		  the data. The detection capabilities of the model were
		  tested with simulated outbreaks.RESULTS:Models were built
		  both for overall visits and for respiratory-related visits,
		  classified according to the chief complaint recorded at the
		  beginning of each visit. The mean absolute percentage error
		  of the ARIMA models was 9.37% for overall visits and 27.54%
		  for respiratory visits. A simple detection system based on
		  the ARIMA model of overall visits was able to detect
		  7-day-long simulated outbreaks of 30 visits per day with
		  100% sensitivity and 97% specificity. Sensitivity decreased
		  with outbreak size, dropping to 94% for outbreaks of 20
		  visits per day, and 57% for 10 visits per day, all while
		  maintaining a 97% benchmark specificity.CONCLUSIONS:Time
		  series methods applied to historical ED utilization data
		  are an important tool for syndromic surveillance. Accurate
		  forecasting of emergency department total utilization as
		  well as the rates of particular syndromes is possible. The
		  multiple models in the system account for both long-term

	Abstract = {We have discovered that T7 RNA polymerase, purified to
		  apparent homogeneity from overexpressing Escherichia coli
		  cells, possesses a DNase and an RNase activity. Mutations
		  in the active center of T7 RNA polymerase abolished or
		  greatly decreased the nuclease activity. This nuclease
		  activity is specific for single-stranded DNA and RNA
		  oligonucleotides and does not manifest on double-stranded
		  DNAs. Under the conditions of promoter-driven transcription
		  on double-stranded DNA, no nuclease activity was observed.
		  The nuclease attacks DNA oligonucleotides in mono- or
		  dinucleotide steps. The nuclease is a 3['] to 5[']
		  exonuclease leaving a 3[']-OH end, and it degrades DNA
		  oligonucleotides to a minimum size of 3 to 5 nucleotides.
		  It is completely dependent on Mg2+. The T7 RNA
		  polymerase-nuclease is inhibited by T7 lysozyme and
		  heparin, although not completely. In the presence of rNTPs,
		  the nuclease activity is suppressed but an unusual
		  3[']-end-initiated polymerase activity is unmasked. RNA
		  from isolated pre-elongation and elongation complexes
		  arrested by a psoralen roadblock or naturally paused at the
		  3[']-end of an oligonucleotide template exhibited evidence
		  of nuclease activity. The nuclease activity of T7 RNA
		  polymerase is unrelated to pyrophosphorolysis. We propose
		  that the nuclease of T7 RNA polymerase acts only in
		  arrested or paused elongation complexes, and that in
		  combination with the unusual 3[']-end polymerizing
		  activity, causes heterogeneity in elongation complexes.
		  Additionally, during normal transcription elongation, the
		  kinetic balance between nuclease and polymerase is shifted
		  in favor of polymerase.},

	Abstract = {P strains of Drosophila are distinguished from M strains
		  by having P elements in their genomes and also by having
		  the P cytotype, a maternally inherited condition that
		  strongly represses P-element-induced hybrid dysgenesis. The
		  P cytotype is associated with P elements inserted near the
		  left telomere of the X chromosome. Repression by the
		  telomeric P elements TP5 and TP6 is significantly enhanced
		  when these elements are crossed into M' strains, which,
		  like P strains, carry P elements, but have little or no
		  ability to repress dysgenesis. The telomeric and M' P
		  elements must coexist in females for this enhanced
		  repression ability to develop. However, once established,
		  it is transmitted maternally to the immediate offspring
		  independently of the telomeric P elements themselves.
		  Females that carry a telomeric P element but that do not
		  carry M' P elements may also transmit an ability to repress
		  dysgenesis to their offspring independently of the
		  telomeric P element. Cytotype regulation therefore involves

		  been an increased interest in both the statistical and the

		  However, most of the vast literature in public health
		  monitoring deals with retrospective methods, especially
		  spatial methods. Evaluations with respect to the
		  statistical properties of interest for prospective
		  surveillance are rare. The special aspects of prospective
		  statistical surveillance and different ways of evaluating
		  such methods are described. Attention is given to methods
		  that include only the time domain as well as methods for
		  detection where observations have a spatial structure. In
		  the case of surveillance of a change in a Poisson process
		  the likelihood ratio method and the Shiryaev-Roberts method
		  are derived.},

	Abstract = {Certain types of cellular differentiation are
		  probabilistic and transient. In such systems individual
		  cells can switch to an alternative state and, after some
		  time, switch back again. In Bacillus subtilis, competence
		  is an example of such a transiently differentiated state
		  associated with the capability for DNA uptake from the
		  environment. Individual genes and proteins underlying
		  differentiation into the competent state have been
		  identified, but it has been unclear how these genes
		  interact dynamically in individual cells to control both
		  spontaneous entry into competence and return to vegetative
		  growth. Here we show that this behaviour can be understood
		  in terms of excitability in the underlying genetic circuit.
		  Using quantitative fluorescence time-lapse microscopy, we
		  directly observed the activities of multiple circuit
		  components simultaneously in individual cells, and analysed
		  the resulting data in terms of a mathematical model. We
		  find that an excitable core module containing positive and
		  negative feedback loops can explain both entry into, and
		  exit from, the competent state. We further tested this
		  model by analysing initiation in sister cells, and by
		  re-engineering the gene circuit to specifically block exit.
		  Excitable dynamics driven by noise naturally generate
		  stochastic and transient responses, thereby providing an
		  ideal mechanism for competence regulation.},

	Abstract = {De novo engineering of gene circuits inside cells is
		  extremely difficult, and efforts to realize predictable and

		  and variation in phenotypes between cells. Here we
		  demonstrate that by coupling gene expression to cell
		  survival and death using cell-cell communication, we can
		  programme the dynamics of a population despite variability
		  in the behaviour of individual cells. Specifically, we have
		  built and characterized a 'population control' circuit that
		  autonomously regulates the density of an Escherichia coli
		  population. The cell density is broadcasted and detected by
		  elements from a bacterial quorum-sensing system, which in
		  turn regulate the death rate. As predicted by a simple
		  mathematical model, the circuit can set a stable steady
		  state in terms of cell density and gene expression that is
		  easily tunable by varying the stability of the cell-cell
		  communication signal. This circuit incorporates a mechanism
		  for programmed death in response to changes in the
		  environment, and allows us to probe the design principles
		  of its more complex natural counterparts.},
